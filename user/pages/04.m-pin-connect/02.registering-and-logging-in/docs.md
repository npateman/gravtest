Summary
-------

This page lists topics that explain how to the use M-Pin PIN-Pad to register and log in to your M-Pin Connect account.

Registering and Logging In
--------------------------

As a member of the M-Pin suite of products, M-Pin Connect uses the [M-Pin PIN Pad](#M-Pin%20PIN-Pad) for registering and logging users in. If you need help on how this process works and how to operate the M-Pin PIN-Pad, refer to the following pages:

-   [Using the M-Pin PIN-Pad with Browser](#)
-   [Using the M-Pin PIN-Pad with a Mobile Device](#)

The procedures <span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">described in these pages will log you in to the M-Pin Connect account that corresponds to the Identity (the email address) you have specified in the M-Pin PIN-Pad. If such account doesn't exist, it wil be created in the process. </span>

**Note**:

<span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">Your M-Pin Connect account (that is, the account for the </span>Identity (email address<span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">) that you have provided in </span>the M-Pin PIN-Pad<span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">) might have been created automatically if you have previously logged in with the same Identity to an application that uses the M-Pin Connect service for authentication. (This application has been configured in some other M-Pin Connect account.) However, having an automatically created M-Pin Connect account makes no difference to the process of accessing it</span> for the first time: the only difference will be that after you log in, you will see the list of the Authenticated Apps already populated with the applications to which you have been logging in as a user.
