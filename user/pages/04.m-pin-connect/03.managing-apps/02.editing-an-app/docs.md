Summary
-------

This page explains how to change the M-Pin Connect profile settings of an application that has been configured for federated authentication with M-Pin Connect.

Overview
--------

Once an M-Pin Connect application profile has been created, there are a few settings that can modify at any time if necessary. These settings are:

-   **Redirect URI** ** ­– the callback URL for the endpoint that M-Pin Connect calls back to. The URL should be available either in the application's admin interface or in its documentation and should be copied from there.
-   **Logo URI** ­– URL of the image to use as a logo for this this application profile. (Should be the application's logo.) The logo will be displayed next to the profile name for easy distinguishing of the application wherever applications are listed in the account. If not provided, a default logo image will be used.
