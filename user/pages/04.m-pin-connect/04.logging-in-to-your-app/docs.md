Summary
-------

This page explains how end users log in to applications that have been configured for authentication with the M-Pin Connect service.

Overview
--------

When an application uses the M-Pin Connect federated authentication service, end users log in to it the following ways:

-   **From the application's Redirect URI** â€“ this is the Redirect URI with which the application is configured in its M-Pin Connect profile
-   **From the user's M-Pin Connect account**

Each of these is discussed in further detail below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the standard way. The user accesses the application's Redirect URI page where they are exposed to the [M-Pin PIN Pad](#M-Pin%20PIN-Pad) and follow the standard M-Pin authentication procedure. If you need help on how this process works and how to operate the M-Pin PIN-Pad, refer to the following pages:

-   [Using the M-Pin PIN-Pad with Browser](#)
-   [Using the M-Pin PIN-Pad with a Mobile Device](#)

Logging-In to an Application from an M-Pin Connect Account
----------------------------------------------------------

End users can also log in to an application by following the Proceed link for that application if the application is listed in the Authenticated Apps list.

Since the user has already been authenticated upon their log-in to the M-Pin Connect account, when they select the Proceed link, they access the respective application directly, without being asked for credentials again.

Accessing an application from an M-Pin Connect account is possible only if the application is listed as an Authenticated App. An application gets listed as an Authenticated App upon user's first successful log-in to the application. Obviously, this first log-in has to be done [the standard way by following the application's Redirect URI](#Logging%20in%20to%20an%20Application%20from%20the%20Redirect%20URI). By the same token, if the user removes the application from the Authenticated Apps list, they won't be able to log in to it from their M-Pin Connect account (Until they log in to it with its Redirect URI again; this will restore the application on the Authenticated Apps list.).
