Summary
-------

This page provides an overview of the process of communicating with technical support from the MIRACL Management Console and explains Support Cases and their statuses.

Introduction
------------

The MIRACL Management Console allows you to you send a request for technical support from the Console's Support page.

-----------------------------------------------

When you submit a support request, this opens a Support Case. A Support Case is all the exchange of messages that takes place between you and the MIRACL support staff on a particular support request. The Support Case will allow further contribution of messages from both sides until you close the Case. Each Support Case has a unique identifying number assigned to it for easy identification and reference.

<a href="" id="Support Case Statuses"></a>Support Case Statuses
---------------------------------------------------------------

Each Support Case has a status indicating whether the issue reported in the request has been solved and whether a reply is currently expected and from whom (you or the support staff). The Support Case statuses are (in the order in which they are typically assigned to a Case):

-   **New** – status automatically assigned to the Support Case when you submit your support request. The Case stays in that status until assigned to a support agent, at which the status changes to Open (After the support staff replies, the status could remain Open, or become Pending, or Solved.).
-   **Open** – this status means that the support staff is working on your request and you should expect an update from them.
-   **Pending** – status indicating that the support staff has requested more information from you about the Case. The Pending status means "the user's response is pending", in other words, it is your turn now to take action and either reply or close the Case.
-   **Solved** – status assigned by technical support after you acknowledge that the issue has been solved
-   **Closed** – the final status of the Support Case. Once this status is assigned, no further exchange on this Case is possible. The Closed status is assigned by you either after the Case becomes Solved or at any point of the communication exchange in which you decide that the Case is no longer topical.

Support Process Overview
------------------------

The communication exchange on a Support Case goes as follows:

**1. You create a new support request and submit it.** At that, a new Support Case with status New is created.

**2. The support request gets assigned to a support agent.** At that, the status of the Support Case changes to Open.

**3. The MIRACL technical support staff replies to the request.** If the support staff needs to continue to work on your Case, the status remains Open, and you should expect an update from them. If the staff requests more information from you and is expecting a reply from you, they set the status to Pending.

**4. You reply to a Case with** Pending status by either acknowledging that the Case has been solved or by initiating another round in the discussion. At that, an update from the support staff is expected so the status of the Support Case is set to Open again.

**5.** Depending on your reply, **the technical support staff either changes the status of the Support Case to** Solved **or replies to the request .** The latter option takes the process back to step 3.

**6. You close the Support Case.** The status of the Support Case is now Closed: the Case can only be read and no new messages can be submitted within this Case by both sides. (If you still need to communicate with technical support on this Case, you will have to open a new Case and refer the ID number of the closed Case in it.)

**Note:**

The replies from the support staff will be duplicated as email messages to the email address with which you are registered in your MIRACL product as admin User or have been [additionally registered in the MIRACL Management Console](#). (For details on how ensure you will recieve these email messages and for instructions of how to submit a support request, see the [Submitting a Support Request](#) topic.)
