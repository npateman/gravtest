Summary
-------

This page explains how submit a support request from the MIRACL Management Console.

Submitting a Support Request – Procedure
----------------------------------------

To submit a support request:

**1. Log in to the MIRACL Management Console either from its log-in page or from the M-Pin Connect service.** If you have already logged in to the Console following a direct link from the product interface, log out and then go to the log-in page of the Console or M-Pin Connect and log in from there. (For details, see [Registering and Logging In to an M-Pin Connect Account](#).)

After you submit a support request, the responses from MIRACL support will show as threads under the respective Support Case in the MIRACL Management Console and will also dub as email messages to you. The email messages go to the email address with which you have logged in to the M-Pin Connect service (and accessed the Console from there) for the session during which you have submitted the support request.

If you submit the support request in a MIRACL Management Console session that has been initiated not from M-Pin Connect but by following a direct link from the product interface, MIRACL will not know your email address and, because of that, no email messages will be sent and you will be able to view the Support's replies only in the Console.

**2.** (Conditional – if you have multiple products/instances) In the MIRACL Management Console, **switch to the product for which you want to submit a support request**.

You can now select any navigation option to proceed. If you select the Support option again (as in [step 3](#Step%203)), you will see your newly created Support Case listed there.
