Summary
-------

This page explains how to close a Support Case in the MIRACL Management Console.

Introduction
------------

Closing a Support Case means changing its status Closed. Closing a Case prevents any further exchange of messages between you and MIRACL support staff on that Case. You are supposed to close a Case once it becomes Solved or when the issue described in the Case is no longer relevant.(For details, see [Using Support Overview](#).)
