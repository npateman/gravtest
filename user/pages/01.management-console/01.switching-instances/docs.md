Summary
-------

This page explains how to switch product/instance profiles in the MIRACL Management Console if you are subscribed to multiple MIRACL products or multiple instances of the same product and have the rights to access them in the MIRACL Management Console.

Introduction
------------

The MIRACL Management Console allows you to access the profiles of all MIRACL products/instances in which you have administrator privileges or for which you have been added as a User in the MIRACL Management Console. (For details on the latter case, see [Managing User Access Overview](#).) However, only one profile can be displayed at a time.

Switching Profiles
------------------

You switch profiles by selecting the profile to display from the <span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">drop-down named </span>M-Pin server:<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">.</span>
