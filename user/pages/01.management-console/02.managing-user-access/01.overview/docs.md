Summary
-------

This page provides an overview of how to manage user access to a particular product or instance in the MIRACL Management Console.

Introduction
------------

The MIRACL Management Console access for a particular MIRACL product or product instance is allowed by default for every User of that product/instance that has administrator privileges in it. However, you can additionally grant access to the Console to users that do not have such privileges. This might be useful in cases when somebody who is not an administrator (or not a user of the product, for that matter) might need some product statistics as in the case when, for example, an accountant or a financial officer in an organization needs to review the subscription plans and the billing history.

The Users added to the MIRACL Management Console have full administrative rights to the product profiles in the Console to which they have been added: they can perform all operations that are possible in the Console including adding further Users. This does not grant them neither administrative privileges in the MIRACL products they use, nor access to the products whose profiles they can access in the Console but of which they are not Users.

**The access rights to the MIRACL Management Console are granted on per-product/-instance and per-User basis.**

Accessing Multiple Products
---------------------------

If you have multiple products/instances, you can grant access to a User to only some of them, depending on what they need. By the same token, to grant access to a User to all products/instances, you must set up the access permission separately for each product/instance.

Configuring Multiple Users
--------------------------

Configuring the access of multiple Users is done individually for each User. User groups are not supported.

Granting and Denying Access â€“ How Is It Done?
---------------------------------------------

### Granting Access

Granting access to a User is as simple as adding the user's email address to the product's profile in the MIRACL Management Console. (The email address must be the same with which the user accesses the product.)

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Granting Access to the MIRACL Management Console](#) page.

### Denying Access

To deny access for a User (to whom access has been previously granted), just remove their address from the User email addresses listing in the product's profile in the MIRACL Management Console.
