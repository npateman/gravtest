Summary
-------

This page explains how to grant access to the MIRACL Management Console to Users that either do not have administrative privileges in a MIRACL product or are not Users of that product at all.

Before You Begin
----------------

Make sure you have read the following pages:

-   [Managing User Access Overview](#)

Granting Access to a User
-------------------------

This procedure is applicable to granting access to a User to one or more MIRACL products or product instances. For granting access to multiple Users, repeat the procedure for each individual User.

To grant access to a User:

**1.** (Conditional – if you have multiple products/instances) **Make sure the currently displayed product/instance profile is the one to which you want to grant access.** (For details, see [Displaying the Right Product/Instance in the MIRACL Management Console](#).)

**2.** In the All Users section of the screen, **select** Add new User.

**2.** In the Email: field, **type or paste the users email address and then select the** Add User **button**.

**Note**:

The email address must be the same as the one with which the user accesses the product.

This will add the email address to the top of the All users listing and also send an email message with log-in instructions to the user. From now on ,the user will be able access this product/instance in the MIRACL Management Console.

**3.** (Conditional – if you have multiple products/instances) **To grant the User access to another product/instance, switch the product/instance profile and repeat steps 1-2.** (For details on switching profiles, see [Displaying the Right Product/Instance in the MIRACL Management Console](#).)

**4. Instruct the user to access the MIRACL Management Console through the M-Pin Connect service** (The MIRACL Management Console will be listed as a Registered App in the user's M-Pin Connect account). If necessary, point them to the [M-Pin Connect User Documentation](#).
