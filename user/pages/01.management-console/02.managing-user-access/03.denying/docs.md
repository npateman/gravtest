Introduction
------------

<span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">You can deny access to a MIRACL product/instance profile in the MIRACL Management Console for a User only if this User has been previously added to the profile from the Console. (See </span>[Granting Access to the MIRACL Management Console](#)<span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">.) If the User can access the profile </span>on the grounds of<span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;"> having administativie privileges in the product itself, their access to the profile can be revoked only by demoting them to non-admin User in the product (or by removing them as a User at all); in such cases, the procedure described on this page is not applicable. </span>

<span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;">This procedure below explains how to deny the access of a User to one or more MIRACL products or product instances. For denying access to multiple Users, repeat the procedure for each individual User.</span>
