Summary
-------

This page explains how to subscribe to a paid plan for a MIRACL product from the MIRACL Management Console if you currently use a free or trial version of a MIRACL product. If you are already on a paid plan but want to switch to a different plan, see the [Changing Your Subscription Plan](#) topic.

This content applies only to the [Direct Download Distributions](#Direct%20Download%20Distribution) of MIRACL products. For the other MIRACL distributions (like AWS distributions) your subscription plans are managed from your customer account in the respective marketplace (like the AWS marketplace).

-------------------------------------

If you have multiple MIRACL products or instances of the same product, make sure the MIRACL Management Console currently displays the product/instance you need to work with. For instructions, refer to the [Displaying the Right Product/Instance in the MIRACL Management Console](#) topic.
