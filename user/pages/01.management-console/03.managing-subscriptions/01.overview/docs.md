Summary
-------

This page explains how to manage the subscriptions to your MIRACL products.

This content applies only to the [Direct Download Distributions](#Direct%20Download%20Distribution) of MIRACL products. For the other MIRACL distributions (like AWS distributions) your subscription plans are managed not from MIRACL Management Console but from your customer account in the respective marketplace (like the AWS marketplace).

Introduction
------------

The MIRACL Management Console allows you to manage the subscriptions to your MIRACL products through its Subscribe option.

The Subscribe option is available in the Console for a particular MIRACL product only if this product has been installed from a [Direct Download Distribution](#Direct%20Download%20Distribution). (For the other MIRACL distributions, like AWS distributions, the subscription plans are managed not from the Console but from the customer's account in the respective marketplace (like the AWS marketplace).)

Managing Subscriptions â€“ Overview
---------------------------------

To manage a subscription means:

-   **Accessing and viewing your subscription and the available alternative plans**
-   **Subscribing to a plan**
-   **Switching to another subscription plan**
-   **Canceling your subscription**

Each of these subscription management tasks is covered in detail in a separate topic.

Managing Multiple Subscriptions
-------------------------------

From your MIRACL Management Console account you can manage subscriptions to multiple MIRACL products (and also instances of the same product): each product/instance has a separate profile in the Console. The Console can display only one product/instance profile at a time so you manage each individual subscription separately, after switching the console view to the respective product/instance. For details, refer to [Displaying the Right Product/Instance in the MIRACL Management Console](#).
